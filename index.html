            <h2>What is Calisthenics?</h2>
            <p>
              The term calisthenics comes from the Greek words Kalos meaning
              beauty and Stenos which translates as strength. Originally,
              calisthenics was a method of promoting health, and thus securing
              beauty and strength, in school children, but itâ€™s evolved into a
              training method that shares a lot in common with gymnastics.
              Unlike gymnastics though, it can be practised outdoors and is
              known as a street workout. instagram icon View full post on
              Instagram Most people discover calisthenics by seeing someone
              doing an advanced version of it. For many of its current
              practitioners, the man they saw was probably Hannibal Lanham, also
              known as Hannibal for King, whose version of calisthenics, which
              he practised in parks around Queens, New York, brought the
              discipline to the attention of millions. For Gallarzo though, his
              inspiration was much more local. Prior to getting involved in
              calisthenics I was already into fitness, I was a personal trainer
              at a big corporate-style gym, so doing the traditional type of
              lifting, says Gallarzo. There was one guy that used to come in and
              do some muscle ups, and I'd never seen that before. I started
              researching it and saw it on YouTube and was amazed, and that
              started my transition to experimenting with bodyweight training.

              <h2>The Benefits of Calisthenics</h2>
              <p>
                So you know how it started, but why should you bother training
                calisthenics? We spoke to Tayo Awoderu, online coach and
                calisthenics trainer for Steel Warriors, who provided a few
                reasons for building muscle with just your bodyweight.

              <h2>No Equipment Necessary</h2>
              <p>
                One of the biggest advantages of calisthenics is that you can do
                it anywhere, without the need for expensive equipment or gym
                memberships. All you need is your body and some open space to
                get a great workout.

            <h2>Improves Functional Strength</h2>
            <p>
              Calisthenics movements mimic the natural movements of the body,
              such as pushing, pulling, squatting and jumping. This type of
              training improves functional strength, which helps in daily
              activities and sports performance.
            </p>
            <h2>Increases Flexibility and Mobility</h2>
            <p>
              Calisthenics requires a full range of motion, which helps improve
              flexibility and mobility. Over time, this type of training can
              help reduce the risk of injury and improve overall health.
            </p>
            <h2>Builds Lean Muscle Mass</h2>
            <p>
              Calisthenics exercises target multiple muscle groups
              simultaneously, resulting in a more toned and defined physique.
              With consistent training, you can build lean muscle mass and
              improve your body composition.
            </p>
            <h2>Provides a Full-body Workout</h2>
            <p>
              Calisthenics workouts often involve compound movements that work
              multiple muscle groups at once. This means you can get a full-body
              workout in a short amount of time, making it an efficient and
              effective form of exercise.
